iSCAM is and Integrated Statistical Catch Age Model
written by Steve Martell. This software was originally
developed for the BC herring stock assessments in 2011.

The project started in the fall of 2010 and is hosted on 
an svn server: http://code.google.com/p/iscam-project/ . This
site is no longer an svn repository, it was converted to
at Git repository in December (6) of 2011.

Additional information about the software can also be obtained
from a website: https://sites.google.com/site/iscamproject/

Obtaining iSCAM (MAC OSX):
==========================
- To check out a copy of the project code, open terminal and
  go to the directory (folder) where you want to keep a clone
  (copy) of the repository on your macbook pro.  If you are 
  using Mac OSX 10.6 or later you will already have "git" 
  installed on your computer. At the command prompt type:

  git clone https://code.google.com/p/iscam-project/

  The above command will now download a copy (referred to as a 
  clone in git terminology) onto your computer in the current
  directory. You only need to run the above command once.  To 
  obtain updates of the repository, you can run the following:

  git fetch https://code.google.com/p/iscam-project/

  To gain write access to the repository contact martell.steve@gmail.com

  THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF USEFUL GIT COMMANDS TO USE AT THE COMMAND LINE$:
      git help                      <list git commands>
      git clone url ILSMR/          <clone repository>
      git add filename              <add new file>
      git commit -m"message"        <commit with message>
      git log                       <view commit log>
      git status                    <view changes & staging>
      git branch                    <list, create or delete branches>
  
  Making an alias for a git command, eg:
      git config --global alias.ci commit
      git config --global alias.lol "log --oneline --graph"

version control system resources:
=================================
Before using git, I would highly recommend spending some time 
learning how to use git.  There are many online resources and
most of them can be found at: http://git-scm.com/documentation

************************* DEPRECATED ************************
- To check out a copy of the project code, open terminal and
  go to the directory (folder) where you want to keep 
  the files and type at the command prompt (you must have 
  subversion installed):

  svn checkout http://iscam-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

  This is a one-time command that will download the entire 
  repository onto your machine.  Future updates etc. can be done
  using simple commands from within your directory. Example,
  'svn update' will upload any new files, or update files that 
  have changed on the repository.

- The following is a list of svn commands that you can use once
  the repository has been checked out onto your machine.
  
  svn update         "Updates the code from the repository"
  svn info           "Obtain the latest commit information"
  svn log            "View the commit log"
  svn help <command> "View svn help or help for a command"

- If you would like write permissions to the repository please
  contact the project owner (email address available at the
  google repository).

Setting up a new project in fba:
================================
- fba is a directory (short for "full blown assessments" ) that 
  contains project folders with a specific directory structure.
  It is important to maintain this directory structure within
  the project folders because the R and shell scripts use the
  relative paths for maintaining inputs and outputs to automate
  much of the running of iSCAM and its outputs.

- to set up a new project, use the makeproject shell script
  when you are inside the fba directory only.
  For example:
    cd fba
	./makeproject MyAssessment  
  It may be necessary to change the permissions if you are 
  running MacOSX, eg: type "chmod 755 makeproject" in terminal
  at the fba directory to allow execution permissions for 
  makeproject.


To Do List:
==========
CHANGED Convert version control system from Subversion to Git
TODO Add make verify target for testing example models to root Makefile

CHANGED Add Makefile's to the makeproject script.
CHANGED Exported svn repository to git on Dec 6, 2011 now in iSCAM-project
